IMPORTANT: 
My main supports both default values and set values. 
Default values are:
iterations = 3, eps = 0.4, confidence = 0.99, percentageOfPointsOnPlane = 0.4

To set specific values, follow the structure:
(int iterations, double eps, double confidence, double percentageOfPointsOnPlane, String filename)
for the arguments in main. (args[0-4]). 

It is important to note that an incorrect input will be overwritten with the one of the outlined default conditions.
